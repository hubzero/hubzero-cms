This is a component for the Partners page of QUBES.
=======================================================

This component will mimic the structure and admin editing style of the com_drwho component example from hubzero at:
https://hubzero.org/documentation/2.1.0/webdevs/components .
If you are reading this and comparing this and the drwho component, you will find many similarites, however you will not find an API controller.
This is because the API controller is not necessary to the component, and was just provided as a example.
	See for yourself by deleting the api folder!

Installation
============

When downloaded as a ZIP file, 
unzip and place the resulting directory into public/app/components

The final result should look like:

    /app
    .. /components
    .. .. /com_partners
    .. .. .. /admin
    .. .. .. ../controllers
    .. .. .. ../help
    .. .. .. ../language
    .. .. .. ../views
    .. .. .. ..partners.php
    .. .. .. /config
    .. .. .. /helpers
    .. .. .. /models
    .. .. .. /site
    .. .. .. ../assets
    .. .. .. ../controllers
    .. .. .. ../language
    .. .. .. ../views
    .. .. .. install.sql
    .. .. .. partners.xml

The install.sql file contains SQL for creating the needed database tables and populating them
with sample data. This may be manually added to the database or with muse.

Login to the administrator area. Go to "Extensions > Extensions Manager". Click the sub-menu
item "Discover". From that page, click "Discover" in the toolbar. If you see "Partners" show up
in the resulting list, click the checkbox next to it and click the "Install" button.
Either SSH into the virtual machine, navigate to the com_partners folder and run the script(password: root):

mysql -u root -p example < install.sql


Muse
============

Alternatively, the component comes with migrations that can be run via the command-line utility, 
Muse, that comes with all hubs. To do so, move the files from the component's /migrations
directory and place them in the /app/migrations folder.

The older migration is required for the component to function properly and installs just the 
database tables and registers the component with the CMS. The other migration is optional and 
only installs sample content.

From the command-line, starting in your hub's root directory, you can run all migrations with:

    php muse migration -f

Views
============

There are currently two views: display (table form; *default*) and cards (card form).  Use the following URL to get the cards view:

    https://192.168.33.10/partners/partners?task=cards
