<p>QUBES Ambassadors are an integral part of promoting professional development opportunities available through QUBES to new audiences. As a QUBES Ambassador, you will present and share information on the Faculty Mentoring Network (FMN) in which you participated. In doing so, you will recruit colleagues to participate in an FMN and/or the QUBES community as a whole, ensure the continued enhancement of their own teaching practices, and share the resources you have created during your FMN.</p>

<p>The QUBES Ambassadors program represents formal recognition of your service within the QUBES community and in addition to receiving funding to assist in extending the reach of QUBES, this award may be listed on your CV or tenure and promotion documentations.</p>
