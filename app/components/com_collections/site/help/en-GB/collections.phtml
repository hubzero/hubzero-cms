	<h1>Collections Help: Collection</h1>
	<p>A collection is where you organize your posts by topic. You could collect resources for creating an introduction to Nanotechnology, for example. You can even put a collection inside another collection!</p>

		<h2>Default Collection</h2>
		<p>Everyone gets a default collection auto-created for you. This is so you already have something you can start to add posts to right away. Default collections are private from the start, but feel free to change the privacy setting as you like. You can also change the to change the title and description.</p>
