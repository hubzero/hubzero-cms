Open source tools have a clear license that allows others to download your code and build upon your work. Closed source tools are kept private to your development team; others will be able to run the tool but they won't have access to the code.</p> <p>You change this option at any point in the development process. When you approve your tool to make it available to others, you'll have a chance to revisit this option. If you're not sure what to choose at this point, pick "_QQ_"closed source."_QQ_"</p>"
SIDE_WHAT_WIKIACCESS="What is Project Area Access?"

The tool development area includes a wiki which can be used to post tool-related information. Some teams use the wiki as a place to post tutorials, examples, and other information about the tool. Opening this to the public means that all users can see the information (though they won't be able to edit it). Other teams choose to keep this area private so that they can post to-do lists and research results without making that information public."

CONTRIBTOOL_ENTER_UNIQUE_VERSION="Enter a unique version number for this release"
CONTRIBTOOL_VERSION_WHY_NEED_NUMBER="Why do I need a version number?"
CONTRIBTOOL_VERSION_WHY_NEED_NUMBER_ANSWER="Users like to know what version of your tool they're using, especially if they reference your tool in scientific literature.  They also like to know when your tool changes, and whether each change is a large one or a small one.  You can communicate all of that information in the version number."
CONTRIBTOOL_VERSION_HOW_DECIDE="How do I decide on version numbers?"
CONTRIBTOOL_VERSION_HOW_DECIDE_ANSWER_ONE="Each published version of your tool needs a unique version number.  Tools usually start at version 1.0.  If you feel your tool is very much under development and needs a lot more work, you might start at version 0.1.  If your tool is well-established and you already have a version number, you can start with that."
CONTRIBTOOL_VERSION_HOW_DECIDE_ANSWER_TWO="For each major change to your tool, you should bump the first (major) version number; for example, when the 1.0 version is rewritten, it becomes version 2.0.  For each minor change, you should bump the second (minor) version number; a small change to version 1.0 leads to version 1.1.  If you make a very small change, or if you have a series of test releases that will lead to a minor version, you can add other version numbers too; for example, version 1.1a becomes 1.1b, then 1.1c, then perhaps the final 1.1 release.  A very small change to that becomes version 1.1.1, then 1.1.2, and so forth."
CONTRIBTOOL_VERSION_HOW_DECIDE_ANSWER_THREE="We don't enforce a particular version numbering scheme here.  You're free to choose any scheme you like, as long as you assign a unique number to each published version of your tool."
