Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HUBzero CMS! We look forward to working with you.

# Reporting Bugs

Please search the repo to see if your issue has been reported already and, if so, comment in that issue instead of opening a new one.

Bug reports containing steps which can be used to reproduce the issue are highly appreciated as those are most easily actionable.

## Upstream Issues

Since HUBzero CMS employs many packages installed via Composer, sometimes an issue will be caused by a bug in one of those packages and not in HUBzero CMS itself. When appropriate, we will implement a work-around and direct you to the package's maintianers to file a bug with them.

# Contributing patches and new features

## Branches

Ongoing development is done in the `master` branch and its use should be avoided. Fixes should be made against a stable version branch.

To contribute an improvement to this project, fork the repo and open a pull request to the appropriate stable branch.
