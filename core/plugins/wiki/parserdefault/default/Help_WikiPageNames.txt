== Wiki Page Names ==

Wiki page names commonly use the !CamelCase convention. Within wiki text, any word in !CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that name.

!CamelCase page names must follow these rules:

 # The name must consist of '''alphabetic characters only'''. No digits, spaces, punctuation, or underscores are allowed.
 # A name must have at least two capital letters.
 # The first character must be capitalized.
 # Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
 # The use of slash ( / ) is permitted in page names (possibly representing a hierarchy).

If you want to create a wiki page that doesn't follow !CamelCase rules you can use the following syntax:
{{{
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:!ISO9000]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"] that page name embeds space characters
 * or simply: ["WikiPageName"]s (!MoinMoin's internal free links style)
}}}

This will be rendered as:
 * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:!ISO9000]
 * [wiki:"Space Matters"] that page name embeds space characters
 * or simply ["WikiPageName"] (!MoinMoin's internal free links style)

Finally, one can also append an anchor to a Wiki page name, in order to link to a specific section within that page.
