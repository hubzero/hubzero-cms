Admonitions are used to make some text stand out or to point out something which doesn't fit in the normal flow of the text.

There are five different admonitions currently supported by the Modern theme. They are warning, caution, important, note and tip. Below is an example of the caution admonition.

{{{
{{{#!wiki caution
'''Don't overuse admonitions'''

Admonitions should be used with care. A page riddled with admonitions will look restless and will be harder to follow then a page where admonitions are used sparingly.
