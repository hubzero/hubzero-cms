### What are wiki pages?

Wiki pages are user-written articles on a range of subjects. Any contributor or a group of contributors can create (and own) new articles, and there can be multiple articles on the same wiki, each written by a different author.

### Who can make a wiki page?

Any member of this group can create a new article. When creating a new article, the initial contributor can choose to have a defined list of authors, all of whom can edit the page, or have an open, wiki-like format where any group member can contribute.
