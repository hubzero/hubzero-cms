The wiki supports inserting HTML into any wiki context.

HTML support is built-in, and does not require installing any additional packages.

## How to Use HTML
Nothing need be done to inform the wiki engine that a block of text should be treated as HTML. Simply enter the desired HTML as-is.

This example should explain:
```
&lt;h1 style="text-align: right; color: blue"&gt;HTML Test&lt;/h1&gt;`
```

Results in:
<h1 style="text-align: right; color: blue">HTML Test</h1>
