	The <?php echo Config::get('sitename'); ?> courses environment offers instructors and students many 
	features to help facilitate the most engaging and interactive learning experience possible.
	And we're adding new features all the time. Many of these feature, like in-depth instructor
	videos, announcements, and more, are available right away, just by browsing the available courses. But, some features
	require an extra level of personalization, and thus require enrollment in the course. Just to give you a taste, some of the 
	exciting featurese available after enrollment include:
