	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>

		<p>
			The course Roles works in conjunction with a user login system to allow or deny a user access to course content and various information or features of a course.
		</p>

		<p class="note">
			Roles are not fully implemented at this time. Currently, the only role that differs from the others in functionality is "instructor".

	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Instructors</span></h2>

		<p>
			Instructors will appear in the "Instructors" list on the course overview and, if discussions are enabled, all comments from an instructor will be labeled as such.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Managers</span></h2>

		<p>
			Managers have full access to a course and its contents, editing capabilities, and so forth but are not listed or noted as such on the overview or elsewhere within the course as instructors are.
