		<h2><span>Sections</span></h2>

		<p>A section not only supplies information about the days and time when students may access content to study a particular subject (course), they also differentiate a particular group of students enrolled in a course from all other groups of students, enrolled in either in the same course or different courses.</p>
		<p>Section dates are used to indicate that a course is being offered during a time period.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Units</span></h2>

		<p>A unit can be thought of as a container of groupings of content (lectures). To use a traditional course as an analog, the most common unit is a "week", which will contain lectures (groupings of content) for each day and a quiz at the end of the week.</p>

		<h2><span>Pages</span></h2>

		<p>This is supplementary content that has information specific to an offering. This is typically the syllabus.</p>
