	<h1>How to View/Download Video Content?</h1>

	<section>
		<p>While almost any video format can be uploaded to a hub, the most common (and recommended) format is MP4 (MPEG-4), also known as M4V (MPEG-4 Video). Most modern operating systems come equipped for viewing this format directly on your computer. If you do not already have the necessary software to view the videos, there are a variety of players available across most operating systems easily discoverable from a quick query in your favorite search engine.</p>
