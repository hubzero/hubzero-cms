	<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_access">How to access</span></h2>
<p>Select <b>Menus → [name of the menu]</b> from the drop-down menu on the back-end of your installation. For example, if a Menu is called "Main Menu", select <b>Menus → Main Menu</b>. Or navigate to the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Menus_Menu_Manager'); ?>" title="Help25:Menus Menu Manager">Menu Manager</a> and click on the icon in the Menu Items column.</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
<p>The Menu Item Manager lists the menu items contained in a menu created using the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Menus_Menu_Manager'); ?>" title="Help25:Menus Menu Manager">Menu Manager</a>.</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Column_Headers">Column Headers</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Checkbox</b>. Check this box to select one or more items. To select all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Title</b>. The name of the item. For a Menu Item, the Title will display in the Menu. For an Article or Category, the Title may optionally be displayed on the web page. This entry is required. You can open the item for editing by clicking on the Title.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Published</b>. Whether the item has been published or not. You can change the Published state by clicking on the icon in this column.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ordering</b>. The order in which to display items. You can sort the list by order number by clicking on the Ordering label in the column heading. If the list is sorted by this column, you can change the order by clicking the arrows or by entering the sequential order and clicking the 'Save Order' icon. This is shown in the screen below.

Note that the ordering is only defined within a single category. For this reason, it is easier to re-order the list if you use the Category filter to select one category. Note that the display order on a page can often be overridden the 'Advanced Options' section of each <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Menus_Menu_Item_Manager_Edit'); ?>" title="Help25:Menus Menu Item Manager Edit">Menu Item</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Permissions_Tab">Permissions Tab</span></h3>
<p>This screen allows you to set the component permissions. This is important to consider if you have sites with many different user categories all of whom need to have different accessibilities to the component. The screenshot below describes what you should see and the text below that describes what each permission level gives the user access to:</p>

<p>You work on one Group at a time by opening the slider for that group. You change the permissions in the Select New Settings drop-down list boxes. The options for each value are Inherited, Allowed, or Denied. The Calculated Setting column shows you the setting in effect. It is either Not Allowed (the default), Allowed, or Denied. Note that the Calculated Setting column is not updated until you press the Save button in the toolbar. To check that the settings are what you want, press the Save button and check the Calculated Settings column.</p>
<p>The default values used here are the ones set in the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Site_Global_Configuration#Permissions'); ?>" title="Help25:Site Global Configuration">Global Configuration Permissions Tab</a></p>

<p>There are two very important points to understand from this screen. The first is to see how the permissions can be inherited from the parent Group. The second is to see how you can control the default permissions by Group and by Action. This provides a lot of flexibility. For example, if you wanted Shop Suppliers to be able to have the ability to create an article about their product, you could just change their Create value to "Allowed". If you wanted to not allow members of Administrator group to delete objects or change their state, you would change their permissions in these columns to Inherited (or Denied). It is also important to understand that the ability to have child groups is completely optional. It allows you to save some time when setting up new groups. However, if you like, you can set up all groups to have Public as the parent and not inherit any permissions from a parent group.</p>
