	<h1>Category Manager</h1>

	<p>Select <b>Content &#8594; Category Manager</b> from the drop-down menu on the back-end of your installation.</p>

	<section id="description">
		<h2><span>Description</span></h2>
		<p>The Category Manager is where you can edit existing Categories and create new ones. Articles are organized into Sections and Categories. Categories are the second level of organization underneath Sections. Every Section contains one or more Categories. The special Section 'Uncategorized' has a special Category also called 'Uncategorized'. These are built in.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="column-headers">
		<h2><span>Column Headers</span></h2>
		<p>Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Checkbox</dt>
			<dd>Check this box to select one or more items. To select all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.</dd>

			<dt>Title</dt>
			<dd>The name of the item. For a Menu Item, the Title will display in the Menu. For an Article or Category, the Title may optionally be displayed on the web page. This entry is required. You can open the item for editing by clicking on the Title.</dd>

			<dt>Status</dt>
			<dd>(Published/Unpublished/Archived/Trashed) The published status of the item.</dd>

			<dt>Ordering</dt>
			<dd>The order in which to display items. You can sort the list by order number by clicking on the Ordering label in the column heading. If the list is sorted by this column, you can change the order by clicking the arrows or by entering the sequential order and clicking the 'Save Order' icon. Note that the ordering is only defined within a single category. For this reason, it is easier to re-order the list if you use the Category filter to select one category.</dd>

			<dt>Access</dt>
			<dd>The viewing level access for this item.</dd>

			<dt>Language</dt>
			<dd>Item language.</dd>

			<dt>ID</dt>
			<dd>This is a unique identification number for this item assigned automatically by the CMS. It is used to identify the item internally, and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this field displays 0 until you save the new entry, at which point a new ID is assigned to it.</dd>
