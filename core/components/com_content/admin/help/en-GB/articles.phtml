		<p>The Article Manager is used to add and edit articles. See <a href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a> below for a detailed list of all functions.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="column-headers">
		<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Column_Headers">Column Headers</span></h2>
		<p>Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value. The list will be sorted in order by that column and a sort icon will show next to the column name, as shown below.</p>

		<p>Click a second time to reverse the sort to high-to-low. The sort icon will change to high-to-low.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Checkbox</b>. Check this box to select one or more items. To select all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.</li>
			<li><b>Title</b>. The name of the item. For a Menu Item, the Title will display in the Menu. For an Article or Category, the Title may optionally be displayed on the web page. This entry is required. You can open the item for editing by clicking on the Title.</li>
			<li><b>Status.</b> (Published/Unpublished/Archived/Trashed) The published status of the item.</li>
			<li><b>Featured.</b> Whether or not the Article will show on the Featured Articles Page. You can change an Article's published state by clicking on the icon in the column.</li>
			<li><b>Category.</b> The Category this item belongs to.</li>
			<li><b>Ordering</b>. The order in which to display items. You can sort the list by order number by clicking on the Ordering label in the column heading. If the list is sorted by this column, you can change the order by clicking the arrows or by entering the sequential order and clicking the 'Save Order' icon.

			Note that the ordering is only defined within a single category. For this reason, it is easier to re-order the list if you use the Category filter to select one category.</li>
			<li><b>Access.</b> The viewing level access for this item.</li>
			<li><b>Created by.</b> Name of the User who created this item.</li>
			<li><b>Date.</b> The date this Article was created. This date is added automatically by the CMS, but you may change it in the Publishing Options - Article section of the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&component=com_content&page=article'); ?>">Content Article Manager Edit</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Hits.</b> The number of times an item has been viewed.</li>
			<li><b>Language</b>. Item language.</li>
			<li><b>ID</b>. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned automatically by the CMS. It is used to identify the item internally, and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this field displays 0 until you save the new entry, at which point a new ID is assigned to it.</li>
		</ul>
