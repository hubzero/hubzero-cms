		<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Column_Headers">Column Headers</span></h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Checkbox.</b> Check this box to select one or more items. To select all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the selected item or items.</li>
			<li> <b>Name.</b> The name of the plug-in.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Status.</b> (Published/Unpublished/Archived/Trashed) The published status of the item.</li>
			<li><b>Ordering.</b> Ordering. The order to display items. If the list is sorted by this column, you can change the order by clicking the arrows or by entering the sequential order and clicking the 'Save Order' icon which looks like a little floppy disk. Note that the display order on a page is set in the 'Advanced Options' section for each menu item. If that order is set to use something other than 'Order' (for example, 'Title - Alphabetical'), then the order value in this screen will be ignored. If the menu item's order option is set to use 'Order', then the items will display on the page based on the order in this screen.</li>
			<li><b>Type.</b> The Type of the plug-in. Some possible types are: authentication, content, editors, editors-xtd, search, system, and user. These are also the names of the website sub-directories where the plug-in files are located. For example, plug-ins with a type of 'authentication' are located in the website directory 'plugins/authentication'.</li>
			<li><b>Element.</b> The plug-in directory name which contains the plug-in's files. This directory will be located in the directory which corresponds to its type. For example, the 'Authentication - Hubzero' plug-in is of type 'Authentication' and element 'hubzero'. So the website directory it is located in is 'plugins/authentication/hubzero'</li>
			<li>
				<b>Access.</b> Which user 'access levels' have access to this item. You can change an item's Access Level by clicking on its name to open it up for editing. The default user 'access levels' which come preconfigured are:
				<ul>
					<li> Public: Everyone has access including website visitors who have not logged in</li>
					<li> Registered: Only users with registered status or higher will have access</li>
					<li> Special: Only users with author status or higher have access</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>ID</b>. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned automatically by the CMS. It is used to identify the item internally, and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this field displays 0 until you save the new entry, at which point a new ID is assigned to it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="List_Filters">List Filters</span></h2>
		<p>The list of plug-ins which appears on this screen may be very large. You can use one of the available filters or any combination of them to limit the number of plug-ins displayed to just the plug-ins which match your filter parameters.</p>

		<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Filter_by_Partial_Title">Filter by Partial Title</span></h3>
		<p>You can filter the list of items by typing part of the plugins name or the ID number of the plugin.</p>
		<p>If you have a large number of items on the list, you can use this filter to find the desired item(s) quickly. Enter either all or part of the name and press 'Search' to display the matching items. You can enter in whole words or part of a word. For example, 'zer' will match all titles with the word 'HUBzero' in them.</p>

		<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Filter_by_Published_State.2C_Client.2C_Category.2C_and_Language">Filter by Published State, Client, Category, and Language</span></h3>
