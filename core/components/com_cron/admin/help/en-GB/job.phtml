	<h1><span>Cron Manager: Job</span></h1>
	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>

		<p>A cron job is tied to a specific plugin event. Plugins will generally be named after the component whose data said plugin processes. For example, "plg_cron_support" will process or manipulate various content found in the support component (com_support).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Parameters</span></h2>

		<p>Each plugin event may specify parameters or settings that can be specified for the chosen event. Parameters are stored on a per-job basis, allowing you to have multiple jobs that utilize the same event but are passed different parameters. For example, one could have a cron job that sends out an email reminder once a week for support tickets that are marked "high prioerity" and another job that sends out a reminder once a month for tickets marked as "normal priority".</p>

		<p>Event parameters are generally optional and some events may not even have parameters associated with them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2><span>Recurrence</span></h2>

		<p>Several common recurrences are specified for ease of use but, if desired, one can specify a custom recurrence by choosing "Custom" from the select list.</p>

		<h2><span>Publishing</span></h2>

		<p>The following options control various aspects of the published state (when and if a job should be run).</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>State</dt>
			<dd>The published status of the job. Unpublished and trashed jobs will never be run.</dd>

			<dt>Start running</dt>
			<dd>A timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) for when a cron job should <strong>start</strong> being run. This allows for a cron job to be set up and published in advance of when one wishes the job to start running. When used with "Stop running", this gives the option of creating a window of time one wants a cron job to be run. For instance, a job can be scheduled to run every week between March and September.</dd>

			<dt>Stop running</dt>
			<dd>A timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) for when a cron job should <strong>stop</strong> being run. This allows for a cron job stop being run after a given date/time. When used with "Start running", this gives the option of creating a window of time one wants a cron job to be run. For instance, a job can be scheduled to run every week between March and September.</dd>
