	<h1>Global Check-In</h1>

	<p>A component which allows Administrators to "check-in" or unlock items currently "locked" whether they are in-use by other users or the item wasn't closed properly.</p>

	<section id="description">
		<h2><span>Description</span></h2>
		<p>Selecting this menu option allows administrators to perform a global check-in of all currently pending or locked items. It then shows the results of the Global Check-in. This is useful, for example, if an Article is locked by a User who opened it for editing and never finished the editing session. In this case, other Users are not able to edit this Article. Performing a Global Check-in releases all such items.</p>
