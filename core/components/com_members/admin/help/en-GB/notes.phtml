		<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Column_Headers">Column Headers</span></h2>
		<p>In the table containing the user notes assigned to users registered on your site, you will see different columns. Here you can read what they mean and what is displayed in that column.</p>
		<ul><li><b>Checkbox</b>. Check this box to select one or more items. To select all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.
		</li><li><b>User</b>. The name of the user.
		</li><li><b>Subject</b>. The subject of the user note.

		</li><li><b>Review date</b>. The date when the user note was created.
		</li></ul>
		<ul><li><b>ID</b>. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned automatically by the CMS. It is used to identify the item internally, and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this field displays 0 until you save the new entry, at which point a new ID is assigned to it.

		<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Permissions">Permissions</span></h3>
		<p>This screen allows you to set the component permissions in the CMS. This is important to consider if you have sites with many different user categories all of whom need to have different accessibilities to the component. The screenshot below describes what you should see and the text below that describes what each permission level gives the user access to:
		<p>You work on one Group at a time by opening the slider for that group. You change the permissions in the Select New Settings drop-down list boxes.
		The options for each value are Inherited, Allowed, or Denied. The Calculated Setting column shows you the setting in effect. It is either Not Allowed (the default), Allowed, or Denied.
		Note that the Calculated Setting column is not updated until you press the Save button in the toolbar. To check that the settings are what you want, press the Save button and check the Calculated Settings column.
		</p><p>The default values used here are the ones set in the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Site_Global_Configuration#Permissions'); ?>" title="Help25:Site Global Configuration">Global Configuration Permissions Tab</a>
		</p>
		<dl><dd><dl><dt>Configure</dt><dd> Open the users component option screens (the modal window these options are in)
		</dd><dt>Access Administration Interface</dt><dd> Open the users component manger screens
		</dd><dt>Create&#160;</dt><dd> Create new users in the component
		</dd><dt>Delete&#160;</dt><dd> Delete existing users in the component
		</dd><dt>Edit&#160;</dt><dd> Edit existing users in the component
		</dd><dt>Edit State&#160;</dt><dd> Change an users state (Publish, Unpublish, Archive, and Trash) in the component.
		</dd></dl>
		</dd></dl>
		<p>There are two very important points to understand from this screen. The first is to see how the permissions can be inherited from the parent Group. The second is to see how you can control the default permissions by Group and by Action.
		This provides a lot of flexibility. For example, if you wanted Shop Suppliers to be able to have the ability to create an article about their product, you could just change their Create value to "Allowed". If you wanted to not allow members of Administrator group to delete objects or change their state, you would change their permissions in these columns to Inherited (or Denied).
		It is also important to understand that the ability to have child groups is completely optional. It allows you to save some time when setting up new groups. However, if you like, you can set up all groups to have Public as the parent and not inherit any permissions from a parent group.
