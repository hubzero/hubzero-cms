			<dd>This limit is the point at which a user will be warned that their quota has been exceeded. At that point, they will have seven days to rectify the issue. After seven days, if they have not reduced their storage below the soft limit, they will no longer be able to write to the file system.</d>
			<dt>Hard Blocks Limit</dt>
			<dd>At no point can the user exceed this amount of storage on the file system. Irrelevant of the seven day warning period mentioned above, this limit cannot be exceeded.</d>
