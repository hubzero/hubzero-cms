	<h1><span>Mass Mail</span></h1>

	<p>Send an email to registered users.</p>

	<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_access">How to access</span></h2>
	<p>Select <b>Users &#8594; Mass Mail Users</b> from the drop-down menu on the Back-end of your installation.</p>

	<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Description</span></h2>
	<p>The Mass Mail screen allows Users who are members of the "Super Administrator" group to send an email message to registered users for the site. Users can be selected based on groups.</p>

	<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Details_and_Message">Details and Message</span></h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Mail to Child Groups.</b> Whether or not to send the Email to members of all child groups of the selected group. For example, if this box is checked and the "Public" group is selected, the email would be sent to all users, since all groups are child groups of "Public".</li>
		<li><b>Send in HTML mode.</b> Whether or not to send the Email with headers that identify it as an HTML document. Email clients that support this will render any HTML codes.</li>
		<li><b>Send to disabled users.</b> Whether or not to send the Email to users who have had their accounts disabled.</li>
		<li><b>Group.</b> Select the groups you want to send the Email to.</li>
		<li><b> Recipients as BCC.</b> If checked, all recipients will be included as BCC entries, so none will see any of the other recipients' Email addresses. Because many mail routers treat Email without a <i>To:</i> entry as spam, the site email will be used for the <i>To:</i> entry.</li>
		<li><b>Subject</b> Enter the Subject of the Email. Try to make it as descriptive as possible. Any text entered in the <i>Subject Prefix</i> parameter in Options (<a href="/proxy/index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Users_Mass_Mail_Users#Mass_Mail" title="Help25:Users Mass Mail Users">User Options &#8594; Mass Mail</a>) will be placed in front of the subject you enter here.</li>
		<li><b>Message.</b> Enter the body of the Email. Any text entered in the <i>Mailbody Suffix</i> parameter in Options (<a href="/proxy/index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Users_Mass_Mail_Users#Mass_Mail" title="Help25:Users Mass Mail Users">User Options &#8594; Mass Mail</a>) will be added to the text you enter here.</li>

	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Permissions">Permissions</span></h3>
	<p>This screen allows you to set the component permissions in the CMS. This is important to consider if you have sites with many different user categories all of whom need to have different accessibilities to the component. The screenshot below describes what you should see and the text below that describes what each permission level gives the user access to:</p>
	<p>You work on one Group at a time by opening the slider for that group. You change the permissions in the Select New Settings drop-down list boxes.
	The options for each value are Inherited, Allowed, or Denied. The Calculated Setting column shows you the setting in effect. It is either Not Allowed (the default), Allowed, or Denied.
	Note that the Calculated Setting column is not updated until you press the Save button in the toolbar. To check that the settings are what you want, press the Save button and check the Calculated Settings column.</p>
	<p>The default values used here are the ones set in the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Site_Global_Configuration#Permissions'); ?>" title="Help25:Site Global Configuration">Global Configuration Permissions Tab</a></p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Configure</dt><dd> Open the users component option screens (the modal window these options are in)</dd>
		<dt>Access Administration Interface</dt><dd> Open the users component manger screens</dd>
		<dt>Create&#160;</dt><dd> Create new users in the component</dd>
		<dt>Delete&#160;</dt><dd> Delete existing users in the component</dd>
		<dt>Edit&#160;</dt><dd> Edit existing users in the component</dd>
		<dt>Edit State&#160;</dt><dd> Change an users state (Publish, Unpublish, Archive, and Trash) in the component.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>There are two very important points to understand from this screen. The first is to see how the permissions can be inherited from the parent Group. The second is to see how you can control the default permissions by Group and by Action.
	This provides a lot of flexibility. For example, if you wanted Shop Suppliers to be able to have the ability to create an article about their product, you could just change their Create value to "Allowed". If you wanted to not allow members of Administrator group to delete objects or change their state, you would change their permissions in these columns to Inherited (or Denied).
	It is also important to understand that the ability to have child groups is completely optional. It allows you to save some time when setting up new groups. However, if you like, you can set up all groups to have Public as the parent and not inherit any permissions from a parent group.
