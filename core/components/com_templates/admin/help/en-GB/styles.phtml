	<h1>Template Manager: Styles</h1>

	<section id="Description">
		<h2><span class="mw-headline">Description</span></h2>
		<p>The <b>Template Manager: Styles</b> screen allows you to manage template styles which you can then apply to your installation. You can specify the default style to be applied to web pages in the public and administrator interfaces. You can also configure different styles for the various menu item web pages on your site. Styles allow to you have multiple different configurations of a template saved and then apply them on a site-wide or per-page basis.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Make Default</b>. Makes the selected template style the default.</li>
			<li><b>Edit</b>. Opens the editing screen for the selected contact. If more than one contact is selected (where applicable), only the first contact will be opened. The editing screen can also be opened by clicking on the Title or Name of the contact.</li>
			<li><b>Duplicate</b>. Makes a copy of the selected template style.  The copy is created immediately and is given the same name as the original but prefixed with "Copy of" and/or suffixed with a number (eg. "(2)") so that it can be distinguished from the original and any other copies.</li>

			<li><b>Options</b>. Opens the Options window where settings such as default parameters or permissions can be edited.</li>

		</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="Options">
		<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Options</span></h2>
		<p>Click the Options button to open the <b>Template Manager Options </b> window which lets you configure this component.</p>

		<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Buttons_Common_to_All_Tabs">Buttons Common to All Tabs</span></h3>
		<p>At the top right of the Options modal window you will see the toolbar.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Save</b>. Saves the template options and stays in the current screen.</li>
			<li><b>Save &amp; Close</b>. Saves the template options and closes the current screen.</li>
			<li><b>Cancel/Close</b>. Closes the current screen and returns to the previous screen without saving any modifications you may have made.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Templates_Tab">Templates Tab</span></h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Preview Module Positions.</b> Enables the preview of the module positions in the template by appending tp=1 to the web address. Also enables the Preview button in the list of templates.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Permissions_Tab">Permissions Tab</span></h3>
		<p>This screen allows you to set the component permissions. This is important to consider if you have sites with many different user categories all of whom need to have different accessibilities to the component. The screenshot below describes what you should see and the text below that describes what each permission level gives the user access to.</p>

		<p>You work on one Group at a time by opening the slider for that group. You change the permissions in the Select New Settings drop-down list boxes.
		The options for each value are Inherited, Allowed, or Denied. The Calculated Setting column shows you the setting in effect. It is either Not Allowed (the default), Allowed, or Denied.</p>
		
		<p>Note that the Calculated Setting column is not updated until you press the Save button in the toolbar. To check that the settings are what you want, press the Save button and check the Calculated Settings column.</p>

		<p>The default values used here are the ones set in the <a href="index.php?option=com_help&component=com_config&page=global_config" title="Global Configuration">Global Configuration Permissions Tab</a>
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Configure</dt><dd> Open the template manager option screens (the modal window these options are in)</dd>
			<dt>Access Administration Interface</dt><dd> Open the template manager manger screens</dd>
			<dt>Create&#160;</dt><dd> Create new styles in the component</dd>
			<dt>Delete&#160;</dt><dd> Delete existing styles in the component</dd>
			<dt>Edit&#160;</dt><dd> Edit existing templates and styles in the component</dd>
			<dt>Edit State&#160;</dt><dd> Change an templates and styles state (Publish, Unpublish, Archive, and Trash) in the component.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>There are two very important points to understand from this screen. The first is to see how the permissions can be inherited from the parent Group. The second is to see how you can control the default permissions by Group and by Action.</p>
		<p>This provides a lot of flexibility. For example, if you wanted Shop Suppliers to be able to have the ability to create an article about their product, you could just change their Create value to "Allowed". If you wanted to not allow members of Administrator group to delete objects or change their state, you would change their permissions in these columns to Inherited (or Denied).</p>
		<p>It is also important to understand that the ability to have child groups is completely optional. It allows you to save some time when setting up new groups. However, if you like, you can set up all groups to have Public as the parent and not inherit any permissions from a parent group.</p>
