		<h2>Configuration File</h2>
		<p>This screen shows the contents of the current <i>configuration.php</i> file which is stored under the main <b>&lt;path to hub&gt;/cms_root/</b> directory.  This file is created for you automatically when you first install the CMS and where most changes of the Global Configuration section of the CMS are recorded.  Please note that none of the settings can be changed from this page. Use <a href="/proxy/index.php?option=com_help&view=help&keyref=Help25:Site_Global_Configuration" title="Help25:Site Global Configuration">Global Configuration</a> to see more information about these settings and to make changes.</p>

		<h2>Directory Permissions</h2>
		<p>This screen shows a list of the directories that the webserver should have write access to.  Please note that all directories listed on this page should say <b style="color:green">Writable</b>. If not, you may need to change the permissions to be able to install and use the CMS successfully.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="PHP_Information">
		<h2>PHP Information</h2>
		<p>This screen displays the full configuration of the PHP server side scripting language that the CMS runs on, together with all the associated system information that goes towards the creation of the web server. It is the output of an integrated php.info script built into the CMS.</p>
		<p>PHP is installed, and runs on the server (hence the server side above), and therefore all the settings are made on the server. The visitor to the web site does not need to have anything special running on their local machine in order to view or use any of the extra functionality that PHP gives to the web site.</p>
		<p>All the settings that are ever likely to be needed are displayed here. Any changes that are required would be made within the <i>php.ini</i> and other configuration files on the web server.</p>
		<p>How much control a web site owner has over this information depends on whether they own the server or if the server host is flexible in their customer approach.</p>
		<p>It is a good practice to know the limitations of a particular server installation. This screens output is used to find detailed information about how PHP is implemented on the server.</p>

		<h2>Quick Tips</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are having problems installing extensions, uploading files, or changing configuration options, check the Directory Permissions screen to make sure you have permission to write to files on your web server. The "Status" of the directories should be "Writable". If not, you may be unable to upload or edit files in these directories.</li>
			<li>When you are seeking help with setup problems, for example in a web forum, it is very helpful to post specific information about your installation. This screen is an easy way to find all of this information in one place.</li>
