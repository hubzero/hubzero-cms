		<p>This tool will delete <i>all</i> Cache files from the cache folders - including current ones - from your web server. As admin functions are cached too, some cache folders might appear as if they were not cleaned because they get recreated before cache content is rescanned after this action.</p>
		<p>Cache files are temporary files that are created to improve the performance of your site. If you have made significant changes to your web site, such as changing your Template or Language, your cache files may be out of date. To avoid any problems caused by out of date cache files, you can delete all of the cache files.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Because this process deletes <strong>all</strong> Cache files, the website may be a little slower immediately after running Clean Cache.  Once this process is complete, users lose the benefit of using the cache files until they are re-created by the CMS to be up to date with your current site.</li>
			<li>In contrast, the <a href="<?php echo Route::url('index.php?option=com_help&component=com_cache&page=purge_expired'); ?>" title="Site Maintenance: Purge Expired Cache">Purge Expired Cache</a> option will check each Cache file individually for being out of date, but the process is slower and requires more system resources.  However, the website should perform close to the same speed for users visiting your site, since all up to date files are still available for your current site.</li>
