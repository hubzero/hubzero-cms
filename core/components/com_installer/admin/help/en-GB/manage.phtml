		<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Column_Headers">Column Headers</span></h2>
		<p>Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value. The list will be sorted in order by that column and a sort icon will show next to the column name, as shown below. Click a second time to reverse the sort to high-to-low. The sort icon will change to high-to-low, as shown below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Checkbox</b>. Check this box to select one or more items. To select all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.</li>
			<li><b>Name.</b> The name of the extension.</li>
			<li><b>Location.</b> Whether the extension is a public front-end or an administrator back-end extension. 'Site' means it is a public front-end extension. 'Administrator' means it is an administrator back-end extension.</li>
			<li><b>Status.</b> (Enable/Disable) The published status of the extension.</li>
			<li><b>Extension Type.</b> The extension type. Some examples of extension types are module, plug-in, template, or language.</li>

			<li><b>Folder.</b> If the extension is a plug-in, the subdirectory of your installation's /plugins directory where the extension is located.</li>
			<li><b>ID</b>. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned automatically by the CMS. It is used to identify the item internally, and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this field displays 0 until you save the new entry, at which point a new ID is assigned to it.</li>
			<li><b>Display #.</b> (Use Global/Hide/Show) Whether to hide or show the Display # control that allows the user to select the number of items to show in the list. An example is shown below. If there are more items than this number, you can use the page navigation buttons (Start, Prev, Next, End, and page numbers) to navigate between pages. Note that if you have a large number of items, it may be helpful to use the Filter options, located above the column headings, to limit which items display.</li>

		<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Quick_Tips">Quick Tips</span></h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Throughout the administrator interface you will see the terms "Publish" and "Unpublish". <i>Publish</i> means the same thing as <i>Enable</i> or <i>Activate</i>. <i>Unpublish</i> means the same thing as <i>Disable</i> or <i>Deactivate</i>. You may see the terms used interchangeably in extension screens and help documentation you find online.</li>
			<li> Some information such as <i>Date</i> or <i>Author</i> may not be displayed for an extension. This is not a problem. It merely means the information was not specified by the extension developer in the extension's installation package.</li>
